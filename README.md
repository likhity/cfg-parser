# C++ Context-Free Grammar Parser

This C++ program reads and parses a context-free grammar. 

Then, based on the request, it will output one of:

1. All of the terminals followed all of the non-terminals of the grammar (in the order in which they appeared when the grammar was read)
2. The grammar with all of the useless rules removed
3. The FIRST sets of the grammar
4. The FOLLOW sets of the grammar
5. A "YES" or "NO" telling you whether or not the grammar has a predictive parser.

This C++ program has been compiled into an executable `parser.exe`.

To use the program, you will pass in a number in [1 - 5] as a command line argument to the executable telling the program which task to run.

```bash
./parser.exe 1
```

The program will wait for the grammar from standard input.

The program expects a Grammar in this format:

Grammar -> Rule-list HASH\
Rule-list -> Rule Rule-list | Rule\
Rule -> ID ARROW Right-hand-side STAR\
Right-hand-side -> Id-list | Îµ\
Id-list -> ID Id-list | ID\

The ID, STAR, HASH, and ARROW tokens are defined as follows:

ID = letter (letter | digit)*\
STAR = '*'\
HASH = '#'\
ARROW = '->'\

So basically for each rule, you specify it as

leftHandSideSymbol -> rightHandSideSymbol(s) *

The star (*) signals the end of the rule's definition.

After you have specifed all rules, input a hash '#' to signal the end of the grammar. Then, press Ctrl+D to signal end of input.

The program will then output the requested information about the grammar.

You can either choose to input your own grammar like this or test the program using the automated test script `test_p3.sh` by doing:
```bash
./test_p3.sh n
```
where **n** is the task number to test.
